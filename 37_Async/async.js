// JavaScript
//     - Synchronous
//     - Single Threaded --> Default

// Execution AudioContext
//     - Execute one line of code at a time.
//     - Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing.

// Blocking code VS Non Blocking Code

// Blocking Code:
//     - Blocks the program --> Reads a file synchronously

// Non Blocking Code:
//     - Do not block execution --> Reads file asynchronously
